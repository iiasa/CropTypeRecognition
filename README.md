This repository contains a Java project for crop recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to accurately identify and classify two types of crops: maize and wheat.

## Features

- Utilizes convolutional neural networks for image classification.
- Trained on a large dataset of maize and wheat crop images.
- Provides accurate predictions for input images of maize or wheat crops.
- Easy-to-use Java API for integrating the crop recognition functionality into other applications.
